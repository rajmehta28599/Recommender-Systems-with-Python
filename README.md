# Recommender-Systems-with-Python

Welcome to the code notebook for Recommender Systems with Python. In this lecture we will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas. There is another notebook: Advanced Recommender Systems with Python. That notebook goes into more detail with the same data set.

In this notebook, we will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. Keep in mind, this is not a true robust recommendation system, to describe it more accurately,it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

There is no project for this topic, instead you have the option to work through the advanced lecture version of this notebook (totally optional!).

Let's get started!
